For this project I was asked to create a mobile responsive portfolio. We made three different html files named index, portfolio and contacts, that were linked and abel to navigate using a responsive navbar.

I also used Bootstrap components and grid system to created the layout of the the three pages.

We also had to make sure that responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window.
