For this project I was asked to create a mobile responsive portfolio. We made three different html files named index, portfolio and contacts, that were linked and abel to navigate using a responsive nav bar. ![Navbar demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62128411/79057382-e7014900-7c15-11ea-9708-fc0bc36218fc.gif)
I also used Bootstrap components and grid system to created the layout of the the three pages.
