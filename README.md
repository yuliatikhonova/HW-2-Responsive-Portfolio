For this project I was asked to create a mobile responsive portfolio. We made three different html files named index, portfolio and contacts, that were linked and abel to navigate using a responsive navbar. 

This example starts at the about me page. I have added the links to my GitHub profile and Linkedin profile. Which both links take the user straight to the profile pages. And by using the nav bar i am able to move to the portfolio tab.

This next gif starts on the portfolio page. I navigate through one of my homework assignments. Which includes the repo and the deployed site. Then i am able to move to the contact portion.
